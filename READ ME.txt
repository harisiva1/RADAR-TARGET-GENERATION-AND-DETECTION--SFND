FMCW Waveform Design:
	yes the slope is around  2e13.
Simulation Loop:
	Generated beat signal is well with in the intial position of target.
	Target position = 110
	Target velocity = -20

Range FFT (1st FFT):
	Yes its with in range.

2D CFAR:
	Yes it matches with the image showed in the lesson.


Implementation steps for the 2D CFAR process:
	a) I have chosen the training and Gaurd cells randomly at the intial stage.
	b) Then implemented the sliding window concept with a for loop.ofcourse margin for edges are considered.
	c) Later values in the training cells are summed.db2pow is taken in to account.
	d) Averaged the summed values and converted it back to pow2db.
	e) Added the offset to determine the threshold.
	f) Finally CUT is checked against threshold and assigned 1 if its greater then threshold else 0.

Selection of Training, Guard cells and offset:
	I added more training cells in order to detect the target well.Moreover i changed offset.

Steps taken to suppress the non-thresholded cells at the edges:
	RDM(RDM~=0 & RDM~=1) = 0;
